# Unreal-Spurious_Correlation
I tried understanding the concept of Spurious Correlation a bit more and accompanied it with a bit of code. 
I test the hypothesis of attractiveness and personality being negatively correlated when choosing a date/partner. 

!! I ran into an issue with the seaborn code regarding the last bit where I run simulations. 
I am working on it and hopefully will be updated soon.
